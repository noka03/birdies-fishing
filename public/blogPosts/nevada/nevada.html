    What an amazing place to explore, the Sierra Nevada Rock Formation is off the beaten track down
    the Mornington Penninsula. Take a drive along the coast heading towards the Point Nepean
    National Park and Portsea, once there make your way down London Bridge Road and park at the end.

    Heading down the steep path and onto the beach your first welcoming site is the amazing views of
    London Bridge, this great rock formation is wonderful to explore during low tide, giving you the
    chance to get out into the cave, and see some incredible rock fishing spots too.

    But as for Sierra Nevada, you will need to hug the beach and keep walking past London Bridge,
    where you will come across some very steep dunes and a closed off area. You can try to get
    around to the left, or head the warning signs and see Sierra Nevada through the "closed" caves.
    Note that a sign does warn not to enter this area.

    These rock formations are amazing to see in person, well worth getting around and checking out,
    but play it safe. This area is heavily affected by the tide, very sharp rocks and lots of
    warning signs based on the old fort and the fact this beach area was used for target practice
    with mortars a very very long time ago.
